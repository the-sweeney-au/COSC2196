    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am Australian by birth of Irish, Scottish and German descent.
        I was born and raised in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where I have lived and worked for various periods of my life.
        I went to school at Holy Rosary Primary School in Derby then completed high school at Catholic Agricultural College Bindoon about an hours north of Perth.
         I currently reside in Derby where I work as a hardware store manager.
        Fun Fact: An image of my brothers and I was once used in a Vegemite advertising poster!</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>I have always had an love for technology. Growing up, I would love watching science fiction movies and television shows, even loved reading about science and technology. 
        I gained an interest in IT ever since I first saw a personal computer, but I never got to really to use computers on a regular basis until high school, but the fascination with never abated. 
        The first computer I personally owned I had built with parts I had researched and obtained myself. My knowledge of computing expanded with my time working as a system administrator at Kwinana Senior High School (now Gilmore College), spending time with TCP/IP and IPX/SPX networking as well as NetWare and Windows NT servers. 
        It was this time I was introduced to open source software like Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, Firefox and OpenOffice. Even today, I am still a heavy user of open source software.</p>
    <p>I came to studying at RMIT through browsing available online courses on Open Universities Australia (OUA) website. 
        I settled on Bachelor of Information Technology delivered by RMIT and OUA assisted me on my way to this course.</p>
    <p>I hope to gain more of a grasp of what is out there in the wide world of IT. What are the current trends and where IT could head in the future. 
        I am hoping this degree would give more of an insight of what career path I can follow in the world of IT.</p>
