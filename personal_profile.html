<h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
    <h2>16Persionalilies.com</h2>
        <p>According to 16Persionalilies.com, I am an Turbulent Logician with the code INTP-T. According to this profile, I am a analytical and abstract thinker, imaginative and original, 
            open-minded, enthusiastic, objective as well as honest and straightforward. Ask anyone would knows me personally if the results of this test are accurate, they are more to likely 
            agree. Though personally I do believe the test accurately describe who I believe to be, I still remain rather sceptical.</p>

    <h2>Personal Learning Profile</h2>
        <p>Using the Personal Learning Profile on the Online Student Support Orientation, I am a Dynamo. It suppose to mean that I am good at managing competing priorities and have a good skill 
            set that I can apply to my studies. Time will tell as I progress along with my studies whether or not this profile actually applies to me.</p>

    <h2>The Big Five</h2>
    <p>Using the Big Five test, I scored:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neuroticism: 79 (High) – high tendency to experience negative feelings</li>
        <li>Extroversion: 62 (Low) – have an introverted personality</li>
        <li>Openness to Experience: 78 (High) – scored high in imagination, artistic and intellectual traits</li>
        <li>Agreeableness: 85 (high) – basically means gets I do get along with others</li>
        <li>Conscientiousness: 81 (High) – has confidence, drive and self control to accomplish tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do feel that the test results are accurate reflection of who I am.</p>

    <p>Theses test do provide a insight into my personality in a measured manor for people who do not know me or who I am. Potential employers can use it to gain an insight into what type an 
        employee I could and how I can fit with my potential co-workers on projects. Though these tests can provide an insight into potential members of an team, they should not be over relied 
        on. Performance of the team is still largely dependant of leadership and management of the team.</p>
