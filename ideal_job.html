<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    <h2>The job description</h2>
        <p>My ideal job would be an Network Engineer as advertised by Freelancer.com. It is a highly technical position dealing with the underlying technologies that drive networks and the internet itself. 
            The position would require deep understanding of core networking fundamentals of which I currently only have basic understanding. </p>
    <h2>My Current Skill Set</h2>
        <p>I already have basic understanding of networking technologies and the TCP/IP networking stack, I can setup smaller networks using DHCP and static addressing. 
            I do have some Cisco network switch experience with the Catalyst series switches in getting them up and running. 
            My Linux experience is somewhat lacking but my understanding of FreeBSD more through and I use it on a regular basis. 
            I have used FreeNAS (now TrueNAS Core) and I am familiar in what it can do.!</p>

    <h2>Obtaining Required Skill Set</h2>
    <p>In order to gain the necessary qualifications I believe obtaining the following certifications would be beneficial in gaining the required qualifications for the position:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</li>
        <li>Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP)</li>
        <li>CompTIA Network+</li>
        <li>Wireshark Certified Network Analyst</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Cisco certifications are widely known and respected across the industry. Obtaining at the CCNA Certification and CCNP Enterprise certifications would provide the essential networking qualifications for the position.</p>

    <p>The CompTIA Network+ certification is provided by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) and also an industry wide recognised certification. The CompTIA Network+ certification would also be a beneficial qualification to have, 
        like the Cisco qualifications, it is network specific and would demonstrate I have the required skill set for the position.</p>

    <p>To fulfil the Linux requirement, obtaining the CompTIA Linux+ certification would be extremely helpful.</p>

    <p>It would be entirely optional, the BSD Associate could be beneficial in demonstrating my FreeBSD experience.</p>

    <p>Wireshark is an widely used, free and open-sourced packet analyser, that is supported on multiple operating systems. The Wireshark certification would also be beneficial to have, as the qualification would demonstrate that I have the skill set to diagnose, 
        monitor and analyse network traffic using the Wireshark tool set.</p>
