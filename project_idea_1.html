        <h1>Real Time Strategy game - Stars of Fortune</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>My open source Real Time Strategy game would be based in the futuristic world of Stars of Fortune created by my brother. 
                It would use traditional game elements and ideas from various existing RTS games.</p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Real time strategy game is my favourite genre of computer games. I grew up playing RTS games like Dune2, WarCraft, WarCraft 2, 
                    StartCraft, Command & Conquer and Age of Empires. My favourite modern RTS is Dawn Of War and StarCraft 2. The only open source 
                    RTS games I have found have been either been clones of Dune2 and Command & Conquer which require the original game assets or 
                    the Age of Empires inspired 0AD, which itself very interesting take of historical type RTS game.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The economy of Stars of Fortune for most missions, would be a traditional resource gathering type economy. Similar to StarCraft 
                    and Command & Conquer in where minerals are to be gathered or mined order to construct buildings or units. Energy would be another 
                    resource that would have to be gathered. Energy would be generated by power generators built by the player, in similar vain to Dune2 
                    and Dawn of War. A combination of minerals and energy would be required in order to build more advanced units and buildings in this 
                    game mode one could call strategic.</p>
                <p>In another game mode, a player would have to capture and hold either individual critical point for a set time period or a capture string 
                    of critical points in order to meet a mission requirement. In this game mode one could call tactical, there is not a base that the player 
                    would be able build or create units from and resources would not available to collect. Instead the player would earn requisition points 
                    for each critical point held. Using these requisition points, the player would be able to call in reinforcements/replacement units available 
                    to the player. Typically the completion of these mission, the player would earn either technology upgrades or new units, which would help 
                    the player progress through the game.</p>
                <p>On each map, the player will start with a small number of worker units. These unit are able to collect resources like minerals (on strategic maps), 
                    build buildings (again on strategic maps) and repair vehicle units. The type of building the worker units can construct would depend on the technology 
                    level of the player in the game.</p>
                <p>Infantry units in the game would be organised into squads. Initially the squads would typically have around five members, where the player would use resources 
                    to add units up to an maximum number (similar to Dawn of War). Upgrades researched at the barracks would allow the player to add command units to the infantry 
                    squads. Research conducted at research facility or armoury would provide upgrades to weaponry and survive ability of the infantry squads. Upgrades conducted at 
                    the command centre would allow building of hero units which can have special qualities, of which can be attached to infantry squads. Having hero and command 
                    units apart of the squad helps to maintain the moral unit in combat. Different infantry squad type could comprise of light infantry, heavy infantry and support 
                    infantry (heavy weapons).</p>
                <p>Ground vehicle units would require a factory building to be manufacture at. These units would constructed and commanded as individual units, which also have their 
                    own set of upgrades that can researched at armoury or research facility. Ground vehicle types would comprise of transport, infantry support, tanks and artillery.</p>
                <p>Air units would require a airport or starport building in order to be constructed. These units could be a fighter, ground attack or transport aircraft type.</p>
            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>The Stars of Fortune RTS game could use the game engine used by 0AD developed by Wildfire games, altered to fit the design parameters of Stars of Fortune. The other 
                    option would to use the Godot engine which is used various different games and game genres. Both game engines are open source and are available on different platforms 
                    such as Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS. Developing the game on either game engine will allow to the project to reach a broad audience regardless of operating system.</p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <p>C++ programming would be a desired skill set in order to develop the game engine and most of the game mechanics. The Godot engine does allow other languages like GDScript, 
                    C# and many other languages like Rust, but it allows visual scripting to be used.</p>
                <p>Graphic artists and 3d modellers would be required to produce vast array artwork needed for the game. From units, map, menus and backgrounds, Graphic artists are a must.</p>
                <p>Game testers would be needed to ensure that game play and the game balance is the best is can be.</p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The goal of the Stars of Fortune project would to provide a science fiction based real time strategy game, that take the best game elements from RTS games that came before it. 
                    Like 0AD had been inspired by the Age of Empire franchise but has become it’s own game. I would hope Stars of Fortune would rise above it’s influences and become it’s own game.</p>
